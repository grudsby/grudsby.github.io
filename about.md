We are roboticists from the CMU MRSD Class of 2018. A failed foray into logo design for our [robotic lawnmower](https://www.groundsbot.com) sparked the name Grudsby, which has come to symbolize not only our lawnmower but our endeavors and bamboozles during life at Carnegie Mellon.

This blog will be a place to discuss papers, share tutorials, and swap inside jokes. We recommend a mimosa in hand and a relaxing atmosphere like Jimmy D's for the best possible Grudsby experience.
